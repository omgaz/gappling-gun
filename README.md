## Gappling Gun :gun:

Gappling Gun is an automated app installer for MacOS.

It bootstraps a fresh Mac install with basic apps and utils via brew, npm, github, and app installs.

A bash script that takes in an array of URLs, downloads the `.dmg`, `.zip`, `.tbz2`, or `.bz2` files, and then installs their `.app`/`.pkg`.

## Automate :robot:

For a new machine install homebrew and git, clone the repo, run the gappling gun:

```shell
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew update
brew install git
# â€¦ or just clone the repo if you already have the above
git clone https://github.com/omgaz/gappling-gun
cd gappling-gun
chmod +x ./run.sh
./run.sh
```

## Relax :coffee:

> Go grab a coffee

Don't worry if a bunch of windows appear, let it do its thing, it'll unmount when its done

## Known Issues :bug:

Sometimes Google Chrome asks to accept T&C on install, you can just `:q` and `Y` to accept

I don't delete any of the install files (in case they fail you can install them manually), but you may need to clean-up when you're done.

Install URLs are recent as at commit. This should probably be extracted for easier updating and maintenance.
